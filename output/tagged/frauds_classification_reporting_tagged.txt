[FRAUD|GOVERNANCE] 21.   INTRODUCTION

1.1   Incidence of frauds, dacoities, robberies, etc., in banks is a matter
of concern.  While the primary responsibility for preventing frauds
lies with banks themselves, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has
been advising banks from time to time about the major fraud prone
areas and the safeguards necessary for prevention of frauds. RBI
has also been circulating to banks, the details of frauds of an
ingenious nature not reported earlier so that banks could introduce
necessary safeguards by way  of  appropriate procedures and
internal checks. To facilitate this ongoing process,  it is essential
that banks report to the Reserve Bank full information about frauds
and the follow-up action taken thereon. Banks may, therefore,
adopt the reporting system for frauds as prescribed in the following
paragraphs.
1.2      It has been observed that frauds are, at times, detected in banks
long after their perpetration. The fraud reports are also submitted to
the RBI, many a time, with considerable delay and without the
required information. On certain occasions, the RBI comes to know
about frauds involving large amounts only through press reports.
Banks  should,  therefore, ensure  that  the  reporting system  is
suitably streamlined so that frauds are reported without any delay.
Banks must fix staff accountability in respect of delays in reporting
fraud cases to the RBI.
1.3   Delay in reporting of frauds and the consequent delay in alerting
other banks about the modus operandi and issue of caution advices
against unscrupulous borrowers could result in similar frauds being
perpetrated elsewhere. Banks may, therefore, strictly adhere to the
timeframe fixed in this circular for reporting fraud cases to RBI
failing which banks would be liable for penal action as prescribed
under Section 47(A)  of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As
applicable to Co-operative Societies).
1.4   Banks should specifically nominate a senior  official who  will be
responsible for submitting all the returns referred to in this circular.

[FRAUD] 2.   CLASSIFICATION OF FRAUDS

2.1    In order to have uniformity in reporting, frauds have been classified
as under, based mainly on the provisions of the Indian Penal Code:
a) Misappropriation and criminal breach of trust.
b) Fraudulent   encashment   through   forged    instruments,
manipulation of books of account or through fictitious accounts
and conversion of property.

3         c) Unauthorised credit facilities extended for reward or for illegal
gratification.
d) Negligence and cash shortages.
e) Cheating and forgery.
f)  Irregularities in foreign exchange transactions.
g) Any other type of fraud not coming under the specific heads as
above.
2.2   Cases of 'negligence and cash shortages' and  'irregularities  in
foreign exchange transactions' referred to in item (d) & (f) above
are to be reported as fraud  if the intention to cheat/defraud  is
suspected/ proved. However, the following cases where fraudulent
intention is not suspected/proved at the time of detection will be
treated as fraud and reported accordingly:
(a) cases of cash shortages more than Rs.10,000.00 and
(b) cases of cash shortages more than Rs.5,000.00 if detected by
management/auditor/inspecting officer and not reported on the
day of occurrence by the persons handling cash.
2.3   To ensure uniformity and to avoid duplication, frauds involving
forged instruments may be reported only by the paying banker and
not by the collecting banker.
However,  in the case  of  collection  of an instrument which  is
genuine but the amount is collected fraudulently by a person who is
not the true owner, the collecting bank, which is defrauded, will
have to file fraud report with the RBI.
In case of collection of instrument where the amount has been
credited and withdrawn before realisation and subsequently the
instrument is found to be fake/forged and returned by the paying
bank, it is the collecting bank who has to file FMR-1 with the RBI as
they are at loss by parting the amount before realisation of the
instrument.

2.4   Encashment of altered  / fake cheques involving two or more
branches of same bank
2.4.1   In case of collection of altered/fake cheque involving two or more
branches of the same bank, the branch where the altered/fake
cheque has been encashed, should report the fraud to Head Office
of the bank. Thereafter, Head Office of the bank will file the fraud
report with RBI.
2.4.2   In the event of an altered/fake cheque having been paid/encashed
involving two or more branches of a bank under Core Banking
Solution (CBS), there could be a possibility of dispute/difference of
opinion as to whether the branch where the drawer of the cheque
maintains the account or the branch where the encashment has
taken place should report the matter to the Head Office of the bank.

4          In such cases also the branch which has released the payment
against an altered / fake cheque should report the fraud to the Head
Office. Thereafter, Head Office of the bank will file the fraud report
with RBI.
2.5 Cases of theft, burglary, dacoity and robbery should not be reported
as fraud. Such cases may be reported separately as detailed  in
paragraph 8.

brief, name of the branch/office, names of parties involved  (if
they are proprietorship/partnership concerns or private limited
companies, the names of proprietors, partners and directors),

lodged with the Police. A copy of the D.O. letter should also be
endorsed to the Regional Office of Urban Banks Department of

5           Reserve Bank  of India under whose  jurisdiction the bank's
branch, where the fraud has been perpetrated, is functioning.

3.4   Frauds committed by unscrupulous borrowers

unscrupulous   borrowers   including   companies,   partnership
firms/proprietary concerns and/or their directors/partners by various
methods including the following:

effects.
(ii)  Fraudulent removal of pledged stocks/disposing of hypothecated
stocks without the bank’s knowledge/inflating the value of stocks
in the stock statement and drawing excess bank finance.
(iii)  Diversion of funds, lack of interest or criminal neglect on the part
of borrowers, partners etc. in adhering to financial discipline and
managerial  failure  with  malafide  intent  leading  to  the  unit
becoming sick and  laxity  in effective supervision over    the
operations  in  borrowal  accounts on  the  part  of  the bank
functionaries rendering the advance  difficult  of recovery and
resulting in financial loss to the bank.
In respect of frauds in borrowal accounts additional information as
prescribed under Part B of FMR – 1 should also be furnished.
3.5 Cases of attempted fraud.
Cases of attempted fraud, where the likely loss would have been Rs.
25.00 lakhs or more had the fraud taken place, should be reported by the
bank to the Fraud Monitoring Cell, Department of Banking Supervision,
Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Mumbai within two weeks of the
bank coming to know that the attempt to defraud the bank failed or was

[FRAUD] 6.  GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING OF FRAUDS TO POLICE

6.1  Banks should follow the following guidelines for reporting of frauds such
as  unauthorised  credit  facilities  extended  by  the bank  for  illegal
gratification, negligence and cash shortages, cheating, forgery, etc. to the
State Police authorities:
(a)      In dealing with cases of fraud/embezzlement, banks should not
merely be motivated by the necessity of recovering expeditiously
the amount involved, but should also be motivated by public
interest and the need for ensuring that the guilty persons do not
go unpunished.
(b)     Therefore,  as a  general  rule,  the  following  cases  should
invariably be referred to the State Police:

i.  Cases of fraud involving an amount of Rs. 1.00 lakh and above,
committed by outsiders on their own and/or with the connivance of
bank staff/officers.
ii.  Cases of fraud committed by bank employees, when it
involves banks' funds exceeding Rs. 10,000.00

96.2    Filing of Police complaint in case of fraudulent encashment of
DDs/TTs/Pay Orders/Cheques/Dividend Warrants, etc.

6.2.1  In case of frauds involving forged instruments, the paying banker has
to file the police complaint (FIR) and not the collecting banker.

6.2.2 However, in case of collection of instrument which is genuine but the
amount collected fraudulently by a person who is not the owner, the
collecting bank which is defrauded has to file a police complaint (FIR).
6.2.3  In case of collection of instruments where the amount has been credited
before  realisation and subsequently the instrument  is found  to be
fake/forged and returned by the paying bank,  it is the collecting bank
who has to file a police complaint as they are at loss by paying the
amount before realisation of the instrument.
6.2.4  In cases of collection of altered/fake cheque involving two or more
branches  of  the same bank,  the branch where  the  altered/fake
instrument has been encashed, should file a Police complaint (FIR).

6.2.5  In the event of an altered / fake cheque having been paid /encashed
involving two or more branches of a bank under CBS, the branch
which has released the payment against a fraudulent withdrawal,
should file a Police complaint.

16Instructions for compiling the Fraud Report (FMR 1):

1 Fraud number: This has been introduced with a view to  facilitate computerisation and cross-
reference. The number will be an alphanumeric field consisting of the following: four alphabets (to
indicate name of bank), two digits for the year (02, 03, etc.), two digits for the quarter (01 for January
– March quarter, etc.) and the final four digits being a distinctive running number for the fraud reported
during                                        the                                          quarter.4
.
2 Name of the branch: In case the fraud relates to more than one branch, indicate the name of only
one branch where the amount involved has been the highest and/or which is mainly involved in
following up the fraud. The names of the other branches may be given in the brief history/modus
operandi against item number 9.
3 Name of party: A distinctive name may be given to identify the fraud. In the case of frauds in
borrowal accounts, name of the borrowers may be given. In the case of frauds committed by
employees, the name(s) of the employee(s) could be used to identify the fraud. Where fraud has
taken place, say, in clearing account/inter-branch account, and  if  it is not immediately possible to
identify the involvement of any particular employee in the fraud, the same may be identified merely as
“Fraud in clearing/inter-branch account”.
4 Area of operation where the fraud has occurred: Indicate the relevant area out of those given in
column 1  of statement FMR 2 (Part A) (Cash; Deposits (Savings/Current/Term); Non-resident
accounts; Advances (Cash credit/Term Loans/Bills/Others); Foreign exchange transactions; Inter-
branch accounts; Cheques/demand drafts, etc.; Clearing, etc. accounts; Off-balance sheet (Letters of
credit/Guarantee/Co-acceptance/Others); Others)
5 Nature of fraud: Select the number of the relevant category from the following which would best
describe   the   nature   of   fraud:   (1)   Misappropriation  and   criminal  breach   of   trust,
(2) Fraudulent encashment through forged instruments/manipulation of books of account or through
fictitious accounts and conversion of property, (3) Unauthorised credit facilities extended for reward or
for        illegal        gratification,       (4)      Negligence     and      cash       shortages,
(5) Cheating and forgery, (6) Irregularities in foreign exchange transactions, (7) Others.
6 Total amount involved: Amounts should, at all places, be indicated in Rs. lakh up to two decimal
places.
7 Date of occurrence: In case  it is difficult to indicate the exact date of occurrence of fraud (for
instance,  if pilferages have taken place over a period of time, or  if the precise date of a borrower’s
specific action, subsequently deemed to be fraudulent, is not ascertainable), a notional date may be
indicated which is the earliest likely date on which the person is likely to have committed the fraud
(say, January 1, 2002, for a fraud which may have been committed anytime during the year 2002).
The specific details, such as the period over which the fraud has occurred, may be given in the
history/modus operandi.
8 Date of detection: If a precise date is not available (as in the case of a fraud detected during the
course of an inspection/audit or in the case of a fraud being reported such on the directions of the
Reserve Bank), a notional date on which the same may be said to have been recognised as fraud
may be indicated.
9 Date of reporting to RBI: The date of reporting shall uniformly be the date of sending the detailed
fraud report in form FMR 1 to the RBI and not any date of fax or DO letter that may have preceded it.
* Banks have to categorically mention the nature of audit the branch is subjected to viz.
concurrent audit, statutory audit, internal inspection, etc.
